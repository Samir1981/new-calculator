# New Calculator
A new educational app to demonstrate your skills in Git, GitHub, and Python.

# Description
This project is a simple calculator written in Python, built from scratch to apply what you've learned in version management and programming.

# Learning Objectives
1. Create new branches to develop independent features.
2. Write Python code with error handling.
3. Log changes using Git with clear messages.
4. Upload changes to GitHub and create pull requests.
5. Document the project by updating the `README.md` file.
6. Handle conflicts or errors with confidence.
7. Organize your workflow systematically.

# Features
- (Currently) Add two numbers.
- (Under development) Additional operations such as division.

## Project Progress
### Goal 1: Setting up the repository and linking it to GitHub
- The local repository `new-calculator` was created and initialized using Git.
- A `README.md` file was created to document the learning objectives and description.
- A `calculator.py` file was created with the basic addition operation.
- The repository was linked to GitHub (`https://github.com/Samir1981/new-calculator.git`) and initial changes were uploaded.

### Goal 2: Developing the Division Feature
**Subgoals**:
1. Create a new branch (`division-feature`) to develop the division operation.
2. Write Python code to add a division function with division-by-zero error handling.
3. Log changes to Git with clear messages.
4. Upload the `division-feature` branch to GitHub.
5. Create a Pull Request to merge the changes into the `master` branch.

**Status**: Running.

## How to Use
- Run `calculator.py` using Python 3.
- Follow the instructions to enter numbers and select the operation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x.

## Notes
- This is a tutorial project aimed at enhancing my skills.
